# üê£ Getting started


OpenAP library has two parts: OpenAP model data and Python modules. 


## Data

Follow model datasets are all made public, under GPL open-source license:

- Aircraft data: Collected from open literature.
- Engines data: Primarily from the ICAO emission data bank, including fuel flow and emissions.
- Drag polar data: Exclusively derived from open data ([reference](https://junzis.com/files/openap_dragpolar.pdf)).
- Kinematic data: Kinematic model (formally [WRAP](https://github.com/junzis/wrap)) describe speed, altitude, and vertical rate.
- Navigation data: Airport and waypoints obtained from [X-plane](https://developer.x-plane.com/docs/data-development-documentation/).


## Modules

OpenAP Python library includes the following modules, which support a variety of functionalities, including performance models, emission models, trajectory generation, and trajectory optimization:

- `prop`: module for accessing aircraft and engine data 
- `thrust`: module for computing aircraft maximum thrust
- `drag`: module for computing aircraft drag
- `fuel`: module for computing fuel flow
- `emission`: module for computing aircraft emissions
- `kinematic`: module for accessing kinematic data
- `aero`: module for common aeronautical conversions
- `nav`: module for accessing navigation information
- `phase`: module for determining climb, cruise, descent, level flight
- `traj`: module for generating trajectories based on the kinematic model

Other modules that can be installed separately:

- `top`: a package for generating optimal trajectories (see [Trajectory Optimization](/optimize.qmd) chapter)


## Install 

### openap

Install the latest stable release from pypi:

```sh
pip install --upgrade openap
```

Install the development version from GitHub:

```sh
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/junzis/openap
```

OpenAP is also published to `conde-forge` repository; you can install the release for conda-forge:

```sh
mamba install openap -c conda-forge
```


### openap-top

If you want to use the optimization function, you need to install `openap-top` in addition to `openap`, Install the stable release as:

```sh
pip install --upgrade openap-top
```

Or, install the development version from my GitHub:

```sh
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/junzis/openap-top
```

## Import

Most of the functionalities (except aircraft and engine properties) in OpenAP are provided as Python classes. You can import these as follows:

```{python}
from openap.prop import aircraft, engine
from openap.drag import Drag
from openap.thrust import Thrust
from openap.kinematic import WRAP
from openap.phase import FlightPhase
from openap.gen import FlightGenerator
from openap.fuel import FuelFlow
from openap.emission import Emission

# when opeap-top is installed
from openap.top import CompleteFlight, Climb, Cruise, Descent, MultiPhase
```

You can also import these Classes directly from the `openap` package as:

```{python}
from openap import (
    Drag,
    Thrust,
    WRAP,
    FlightPhase,
    FlightGenerator,
    FuelFlow,
    Emission,
)
```
