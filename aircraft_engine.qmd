# ðŸª¬ Aircraft and engines

The `prop` package in `openap` allows users to obtain aircraft and engine-related data quickly. We will demonstrate usage through the following example.

## Supported aircraft type codes

First, we need to import the `prop` package from the OpenAP library.

```{python}
from openap import prop
from pprint import pprint
```

We can get a list of available aircraft `openap.prop.available_aircraft()` function:

```{python}
avaiable_aircraft = prop.available_aircraft()

print(f"Supports {len(avaiable_aircraft)} aircraft types")
print(avaiable_aircraft)
```

## Aircraft data

We can get the parameters for one aircraft using `openap.prop.aircraft()` function:

```{python}
aircraft = prop.aircraft("A320")
pprint(aircraft)
```


## Engine data

The engine data can be obtained with `openap.prop.engine()` function:

```{python}
engine = prop.engine("CFM56-5B4")
engine
```
