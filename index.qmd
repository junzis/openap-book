## Synopsis

Welcome to the OpenAP handbook, a comprehensive guide to unlocking the full potential of the OpenAP aircraft performance library. This book is designed to help you navigate the vast capabilities of OpenAP, an open-source initiative that has been revolutionizing air transport research since its inception in 2019.

The first part of this book takes you through the core components that form the foundation of OpenAP. From the fundamentals of aircraft and engine data (Chapter 1) to the intricacies of drag and maximum thrust calculations (Chapter 2), kinematic models (Chapter 3), and flight phase identification (Chapter 4), we delve into the key components that make OpenAP an indispensable tool for researchers, developers, and aviation professionals. You will also learn how to harness OpenAP's trajectory generation capabilities (Chapter 5) and analyze fuel and emission data (Chapter 6).

The second part focuses on the Trajectory Optimizer Package (TOP), an extension of OpenAP. Here, you will learn how to generate fuel-optimal and other types of optimal trajectories (Chapter 7). You will discover how to incorporate wind data into your optimizations (Chapter 8). Additionally, you will learn how to use TOP to handle more complex four-dimensional grid costs in your optimization problems, such as contrail formation (Chapter 9).

Each chapter provides detailed insights into the underlying concepts, methodologies, and best practices, empowering you to make the most of OpenAP. Whether you're a seasoned expert or new to the field, this manual will help you navigate the OpenAP library effectively. The goal is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage OpenAP in your research. Let's embark on this journey together and explore the possibilities that OpenAP has to offer.

Enjoy the reading!
