## Synopsis

Welcome to the OpenAP handbook, a comprehensive guide to unlocking the full potential of the OpenAP aircraft performance library. This book is designed to help you navigate the vast capabilities of OpenAP, an open-source initiative that has been revolutionizing the field of air transport research since its inception in 2019.

Within different parts of the book, I will take you on a journey through the eight core chapters that form the foundation of OpenAP. From the fundamentals of aircraft and engine data (Chapter 2) to the intricacies of drag and maximum thrust calculations (Chapter 3), kinematic models (Chapter 4), and flight phase identification (Chapter 5), we will delve into the key components that make OpenAP an indispensable tool for researchers, developers, and aviation professionals.

You will also learn how to harness the power of OpenAP's trajectory generation capabilities (Chapter 6), analyze fuel and emission data (Chapter 7), and optimize trajectories with precision (Chapter 8). Each chapter is designed to provide a detailed understanding of the underlying concepts, methodologies, and best practices, empowering you to get the most out of OpenAP.

Whether you are a seasoned expert or new to the field, this manual helps you navigate the OpenAP library. The goal is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage OpenAP for your research.
