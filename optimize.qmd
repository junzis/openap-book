# ðŸ¦¸ Trajectory Optimizer


Previously, the majority of flight optimizers mentioned in the literature remained closed-source, which posed a significant drawback in terms of reproducible research.

**The trajectory optimizer (TOP)** addresses this lack of open-source flight trajectory optimizer by providing everyone with open access to trajectory optimization based on a non-linear optimal control direct collocation approach. 

The `TOP` library can consider 3D or 4D wind fields. It can be utilized in various flight phases, either individually or in combination. It provides traditional fuel and cost index objectives alongside climate metrics-based objectives that incorporate global warming or temperature potential. 

Furthermore, I have designed a mechanism to include a complex 4D cost grid in trajectory optimization. This new mechanism allows easy generation of, for example, contrail-optimal trajectories.

## Paper

The optimization framework was first published in my following paper:
[@sun2022top](https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace9070383)

Note that there have been quite many improvements and changes to the software code since the paper was published.

## Install

The `opeanp.top` library is designed to be a module inside the `openap` scope. You can install the most recent release thorugh pip:

```sh
pip install --upgrade openap-top
```

This will install `openap.top` and related dependencies. 

Alternatively, if you want to install the most recent development version:

```sh
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/junzis/openap-top
```
